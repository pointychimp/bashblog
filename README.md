BashBlog 2
==========

My adaptation of [cfenollosa's bashblog](https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog)

I hope to completely mirror the capabilities of bashblog; in fact, I will pull code from it. The difference being that I will attempt to use local variables and other such things. I found it kind of hard to work on bashblog, and admittedly that could be all my fault.

Let's see how this goes.


TODO
----

* EVERYTHING
seriously though ... next steps
* allow user to use "post" option 
* above, but with markdown
* prompt them after done editing post to post it, save as draft, discard, etc.
