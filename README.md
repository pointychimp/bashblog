BashBlog 2
==========

My adaptation of [cfenollosa's bashblog](https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog)

I hope to completely mirror the capabilities of bashblog; in fact, I will pull code from it. The difference being that I will attempt to use local variables and other such things. I found it kind of hard to work on bashblog, and admittedly that could be all my fault.

Let's see how this goes.


TODO
----

* EVERYTHING

seriously though ... next steps

* make posts (currently doesn't actually generate files)
* flesh out edit function, with simple editing and editing source + republishing with editDate
* other functions .... rebuild, reset come to mind
